https://github.com/OCA/l10n-finland/

Configuration
=============
Your company should have following information configured:

Missing information won't cause an error in Finvoice generation,
but will likely cause a rejection when trying to import the Finvoice.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================
This module would benefit from rewrite.
Lots of logic is coming from 14.0 an outdated/complicated.
